Some students will come and ask us/email if they have problems accessing what they need; some will let us know later (e.g. questionnaire time); some will go to their fac/dep library for help, some will ask for online help from the app/web page etc themselves.  More should be done to access opinions from those people who do not interact with libraries very well.","I hadn't really heard much about ThinkLab before this questionnaire","1. To keep the library running to the same standards in the face of diminishing resources, ensuring that library users do not find a lowering of standards. (To be like a swan!)
2. To get to know our users again, and to get them to communicate with us.  Face to face interactions have been at a minimum over the pandemic and so there is a legacy of students struggling by themselves.  It is now harder to break the perceived barrier between library users (especially students) and the library staff.  Once the 'barrier' has been broken then the student usualy starts to make more use of our service and will come in and ask the non-important, 'silly' little questions that can make access to information so much easier for them.
3. To encourage the students into the physical library again.  They have become used ot working remotely, so much so that we believe a few of them are not using the print resources they are required to use (e.g. when information is not available electronically).  We need to try to break down the barrier again, to prove our relevance to them, not just in terms of academic resources, but by using attractions like our Light Reading collection, board game collection etc to get them to visit us in person.  Once this has happened, some of them then begin to use the library and make use of more of our resources.","Librarian","Our main target audience is students on taught courses (e.g. undergrads and MPHils) but we also serve phds, staff and fellows.","1. How to get students/researchers to make use of the material we have.  This is not just a case of promotion.  It is more of a case of there being more and more information available and helping them make use of the information and services we have to offer. We have to justify immediate relevance in amongst their competing time pressures - you cannot just provide the information and hope that people will find and make use of it.
2. Technological challenges and barriers.  More and more information is available to users, in a variety of ways.  There is also a quick turnover of technology, all requiring new learning or differing access.  Whilst the users skills are generally improving, there is a widening gap between those who have good technology skills and those with poorer skills.  Also, technology available to access this information is becoming more disparate.  Many people do not have the skills to use the information needed, and it is often assumed that everyone has these skills and so basics do not need to be taught. Students (and staff and fellows) are often embarrassed to ask about things they feel they should already know. 
3. The assumption that 'everything is electronic now and so should be available immediately'.   Many books and textbooks or journals are not available electronically and so print copies still need to be used.  This can mean that it might take longer than expected for someone to get to use an item.  Also, many items are not available to buy as even out of print copies can be unavailable.  Added to this there are people who prefer print over electronic, and vice versa.  Also there preferences change when looking at the type of material, or even the time of day.  This can mean the we are expected to provide information in both print and electronic format,  extending our costs and workload.
4. Covid implications.  Work and study patterns changed over the pandemic and we don;t know how much these new ways of working will stay, or if people will revert to how they used to work before covid - practically it will probably be a hybrid version, but it makes this more difficult to plan for the future.","1. Results from our yearly library questionnaire. Both factual and subjective answers are asked for. 
2. Simple library figures like numbers from our automatic gate counts, borrowing/viewing figures from the Library Management system or ebooks@Cambridge team, accession numbers etc.  ","Technological skills, staffing time and levels, budgets, busy times of the year, e.g. the exam period or the start of term.  Librarians work tends ot be reactive, so it can be difficult to plan for free periods to work on new projects.  We never know what we need to respond to until we get a query in.
Collaborative efforts work well with libraries - everyone has differing skills and often college libraries are doing the same projects as each other so we often work on projects together to save time and energy.  ","1. We have just updated our web page, and for example, created a new accessibility page for the library.  We plan to help with a library study skills web page leter this summer too.  the information on the main college web page should be easlity accessable and immediately relevant. 
2. Our objective is to find the best way to communicate with students and to provide the information in that format.  We use facebook as the main form of communication for non-urgent matters.  (Email for urgent things).  We are willing to change, perhaps to instagram or twitter if the students would prefer it, but for the short term, they say facebook is still the preferred form of communication (maybe not for 1st year undergrads, but it is for the other years).  This is something that we are keeping track of and are willing to move on quickly as things change.  
3. More fun items to hook students in to supporting and using the library, and well as more academic interaction with outwith College.  We do engage digitally with students, College and the outside world but we could do a lot more if we had more time.  We also contribute to forums, conferences, non-library blogs, libguides etc.  Vague future plans are more fun campaigns (e.g. digital advent calendars, setting up a 'treasure hunt' type of induction for students at the start of the year), but we are stretched to provide the basic library services at the moment and these things get done when we have space to plan and think.  I have wanted to set up the treasure hunt to run alongside our formal inductions for about 3 years now but I have't had time to plan or implement this ... hopefully it may happen this summer, but this will depend on staffing levels.
4. To continue to answer queries and emails as fast as possible,  Reaction times are important - users expect quick answers when they ask a question."
